## Build

Docker builds are created with [bedag/image-build](https://github.com/bedag/image-build).

`gcr.io/distroless/cc` are used because we do not need any common linux binaries, [here](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) you can find more information about distroless images. For troubleshooting we recommend to use our `-debug` images. For more information go to [Debug](#Debug) section.

Every Sunday(`0 0 * * SUN`) we automatically update all [supported tags](#Tags) with the current upstream image.

## Debug

In our production image there are no binaries for troubleshooting. Therefore if u like to troubleshoot you should use our debug image like this:

```
docker run -it bedag/exabgp:latest-debug
docker run -it bedag/exabgp:4-debug
```

In the debug image busybox is installed. You can find all busybox supported commands like this:

```
busybox --list
```

## Tags

Supported tags are:

- `latest`, `4`, `4.2`, `4.2.13`, `latest-debug`, `4-debug`, `4.2-debug`, `4.2.13-debug`

## Security notice

Security scans are performed via [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) and reported in [github](./security). Scans are only performed to the `latest` tag, which should include all libs vulnerabilities from all possible tags.
